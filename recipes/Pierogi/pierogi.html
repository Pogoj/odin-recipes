            <li> 4 tablespoons of oil - 50 ml </li>
            <li> half a teaspoon of salt </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Ingredients for Pierogi Stuffing </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> 300 grams semi-skimmed cottage cheese </li>
            <li> large onion - 300 grams </li>
            <li> 500 grams boiled potatoes</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons of clarified butter </li>
            <li> half a flat teaspoon each of salt and pepper </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p> Before you can start, make sure you have the following items: </p>
            <ul> 
                <li> a clean countertop or a pastry board </li>
                <li> a rolling pin </li>
                <li> a round dumpling punch or a glass that's about 7 - 9cm in diameter </li>
                <li> a cotton cloth </li>
                <li> a wide pot </li>
                <li> a strainer </li>
            </ul>
            <p> <i> The glass has a capacity of 250 ml in my case.</i></p>
            
    <h2>Preparing the Pierogi Dough</h2>
        <p> Sift flour into a wide bowl. Half a kilogram of flour, this is half of a standard one kilogram package. 
            Add half a teaspoon of salt and four tablespoons of oil, such as rapeseed oil. 
            Grape seed oil and other oils with a mild flavor will also work. Pour in a cup of hot, boiled water 
            and stir the dough with a spoon and then start kneading it. 
        </p>

        <p> You can also boldly knead the dough in a machine such as a Thermomix. The dough should be soft, pliable and elastic. 
            Wrap the finished dough ball in plastic wrap and set aside for 30 minutes. Once the dough has rested, 
            it will not shrink when you roll it out.
        </p>
        
    <h2>Preparing the Pierogi Stuffing</h2>
        <p> Peel about 650-700 grams of potatoes and boil until soft in salted water. Pour off the water, 
            drain thoroughly and grind the potatoes or beat them with a pestle to a mashed potato. 
            You should get out no more than 500 grams of potato pulp. Set the puree aside to cool. 
            Also add half a flat teaspoon each of salt and pepper to the bowl with the ground potatoes. 
        </p>
        <p> <i> Tip: It is best to grind the cooked potatoes in a machine or run them through a press while still slightly warm. 
            Keep in mind that warm potatoes are easier to run through a press than cold ones from the refrigerator, which then get tough. 
            However, if you are grinding potatoes in a machine, you can also use potatoes from lunch, from the previous day. 
            Then they can also be cold. </i> 
        </p>
        <p> Peel and shred a large onion. You can also use a few smaller pieces with a total weight of about 300 grams. 
            Add two tablespoons of clarified butter to a heated frying pan. 
            Add the shredded onions and saut√© on a medium burner for about 10 minutes. 
            You can replace the butter with fine olive oil or other favorite frying oil. 
        </p>
        <p> For the stuffing you need 300 grams of cottage cheese. You can use semi-fat or fat cottage cheese in cubes, 
            the selvedge type (in blocks) or in "triangles" packed in paper. You can grind the cottage cheese in a machine 
            or run it through a hand press. For the stuffing for Ruthenian dumplings, I do not use ground cheese curd in a bucket, 
            because even those very good quality ground curds are not as compact as those sold in cubes. 
        </p>
        <p> Mix the potato mixture, ground cottage cheese, onion glazed with butter and salt and pepper together in one bowl. 
            The stuffing for Ruthenian dumplings is now ready. 
        </p>
    <h2>Shaping the Pierogi</h2>
        <p> After this time, unwrap the dough from the foil and divide it into 3 pieces. 
            Set two pieces aside and cover with a cotton cloth to keep the dough from drying out. Roll out one piece thinly on a pastry 
            board or a lightly floured countertop. Using a punch with a diameter of about 8 cm, cut out round cakes for dumplings.  
            In the center of the pancake put stuffing for Ruthenian dumplings. I always give a lot of stuffing. 
            I flatten the ball of stuffing slightly into the shape of a roll to perfectly fill the inside of the dumpling. 
            Fold the dumplings in half and glue the sides together. After gluing the joint, I recommend making an additional frill. 
        </p>    
        <p> <i> Tip: Gather the leftover dough after punching out the dumplings and finally combine into a ball. Roll out the dough again 
            and cut out the pies for the dumplings. You can also use the leftover dough to cook dumplings for dumplings at the end. </i> 
        </p>
        <p> Place the dumplings side by side on a pastry board. To keep the pending dumplings from drying out, cover them with a slightly damp cotton cloth.
        </p>
    <h2> Cooking the Pierogi </h2>
        <p> 
            Place each batch in a pot of salted, boiling water. The water should not bubble heavily. Fish out the dumplings after about 3-4 minutes 
            after they float to the surface. Cook all the dumplings this way. I came out with about 60 dumplings. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I topped the finished Russian dumplings with clarified butter and glazed onions. You prepare such a covering identically to the onions 
            in butter, which you use to make the stuffing for the pierogi.
